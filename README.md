# Requirements
- iOS 14
- macOS Big Sur
- Xcode 12


# Layout
This app uses the following SwiftUI features

- Sidebar and Tab bar navigation pattern, which translates well to all platforms and give us the power to adapt for any type of content
- Lazy Grids to make the layout adaptive to all devices
- Matched Geometry Effect to create beautiful transitions between screens without the complexity

## Lazy Grid Layout
One of the biggest upgrades is the new Lazy Grid in SwiftUI. Not only does it make the layout completely adaptive to every screen size, it'll lazy load the content for better performance. Lazy grids can be spread vertically or horizontally and can be both flexible and adaptive (similar to auto-fit in CSS Grid). Lazy Grid Layout

## Matched Geometry Effect
It helps us to create beautiful transitions between two different views. Shared elements will animate smoothly from one screen to another. This makes animations much more manageable and allows you to create beautiful app experiences without adding complexity.

## Sidebar
The sidebar is now a standard for iPadOS and macOS. It makes an app significantly easier to navigate, maximizing the use of the screen's real estate.
